## Inspiration
TikTok is scary. It seems to always know what I want to see and gives it to me. While it can't actually know, what if something could? That's why we decided to make Mindy, your companion that actually knows what you want using brain waves. 

## What it does
Mindy can use the EEG signals from a headpiece to approximate your mood. Not only is she a friend to feel and express them with you with servos and an LCD display, but she can also give you content based on this using DALL-E, Spotify, and AI via LLM sentiment analysis. 

## How we built it
We built the project using the OpenBCI kit as the backbone, React and Flask to power our web app, and Arduino to bring our hardware to life. With the help of trips to the dollar store, we created a vessel that perfectly embodies the passion and urgency we have for mental health!

## Challenges we ran into
Working with the OpenBCI kit was a difficult journey. What should have been an easy connection process between the EEG and the backend, was a real Snorlax on the bridge! 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to pull together a project with such a large scope. Our project spans various unfamiliar software frameworks from ECG and biosensing devices, to AI models and Spotify APIs. Finally, after all the various issues we had with API keys and unreliable/outdated documentation, we are proud we even had something that worked. 

## What we learned
Staying up for 24 hours straight is not super healthy. Perhaps we need Mindy's help after this ðŸ˜­

## What's next for Mindosaur
Our next steps are to improve the web app with data visualization and integrating a database to keep track of your brain activity history. This way, we can build an even stronger understanding towards your own focus habits, and provide solutions to further improve your productivity.
